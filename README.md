# AutoGPT4All: Next-Gen AI Code Evolution

AutoGPT4All is a pioneering AI-driven codebase that harnesses GPT-4's capabilities to self-improve and generate novel applications through quines and recursive enhancements.

## What is AutoGPT4All?

AutoGPT4All is an open-source initiative that brings forth a new era of autonomous coding. By utilizing GameGAN and dynamic AI, it creates a self-sustaining system that learns, adapts, and evolves to simulate environments and generate new code paradigms.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FlamesCo/AutoGPT4AllV0.1.git
cd AutoGPT4AllV0.1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the initialization script
npm run init

# Start the simulation
npm run simulate
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to witness the AI in action.
