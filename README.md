Bash
# Clone the AutoGPT4All repository
git clone https://github.com/FlamesCo/AutoGPT4AllV0.1.git
cd AutoGPT4AllV0.1

# Install the necessary packages
npm install

Once the necessary packages are installed, you can initialize the AutoGPT4All environment and engage the simulation process.

Bash
# Initialize the AutoGPT4All environment
npm run init

# Engage the simulation process
npm run simulate

The AutoGPT4All API will then be available at http://localhost:8080.

API Documentation
The AutoGPT4All API provides a number of endpoints for interacting with the simulation.

/simulate
The /simulate endpoint is used to start a new simulation.

POST /simulate
This endpoint does not require any body parameters.

/stop
The /stop endpoint is used to stop the current simulation.

POST /stop
This endpoint does not require any body parameters.

/get_simulation_status
The /get_simulation_status endpoint is used to get the status of the current simulation.

GET /get_simulation_status
This endpoint does not require any query parameters.

/get_simulation_output
The /get_simulation_output endpoint is used to get the output of the current simulation.

GET /get_simulation_output
This endpoint does not require any query parameters.

Example Usage
The following example shows how to use the AutoGPT4All API to start a new simulation and get the output of the simulation.

Python
import requests

# Start a new simulation
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/simulate')

# Get the status of the simulation
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/get_simulation_status')

# Get the output of the simulation
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/get_simulation_output')

# Print the output of the simulation
print(response.content)
